### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am into low-level machine learning (CV, NLP, HPC) stuff and multimedia programming (live video streaming & processing, NLE, NVRs, etc.). I actively explore research papers, open-source projects, and the latest discoveries in LLMs and cutting-edge AI. I enjoy re-implementing concepts from scratch, diving deep into code, and experimenting with new ideas.

I like pure C, Rust, GStreamer and whole GNOME stack.
