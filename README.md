### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I specialize in low-level machine learning (CV, NLP) and multimedia programming (particularly in live video streaming, NLE, NVRs, etc.).

My approach is hands-on: I actively explore research papers, open-source projects, and the latest discoveries in LLMs and cutting-edge AI. I enjoy re-implementing concepts from scratch, diving deep into code, and experimenting with new ideas.

Always open to discussions on high-performance computing, AI optimization, and video processing.

I like pure C, Rust, GStreamer and GNOME stack.
